            Responsible Gaming tips
          </i>
          <br>
          <i>For many people gambling is exciting, fun and entertaining, but if you feel you are developing a
            problem with gambling, here are some suggestions on how you can regain control:
            Decide on a loss limit ahead of time and stick to it. You can set this on the account limits
            page.
            Never borrow money to gamble.
            Balance gambling with other activities.
            Don't gamble when highly stressed, depressed or intoxicated.
            Only gamble with money set aside for entertainment, never with money for everyday expenses.

            If you argue frequently with family or friends about spending too much time and money on
            gambling and find that you cannot stop or limit yourself.
            If you are gambling money needed for housing, education, health care, food, clothing or
            utilities.
            When you are with your family, at work or at social events, you find that you are constantly
            thinking about your next bet.
