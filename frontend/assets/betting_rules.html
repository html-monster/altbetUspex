        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> takes every effort to ensure that trading is carried out in a fair and secure
          manner.
        </p>

          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> reserves the right to amend these rules as necessary. <strong>alt.bet</strong>

          not accept responsibility for any errors or omissions with regard to event and market data.
        </p>
        <p>Unmatched trade orders are active immediately without any delay before and during the event.</p>
        <p>
          Trade Orders are matched in price-time priority. Orders with a better price will be matched first. If the
          price is equal, trade orders will be matched in the order they were received by the
          <strong>alt.bet</strong>
          exchange.
        </p>
        <p>These rules will apply unless superseded by the Terms and Conditions or market- specific rules.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="responsibility">
        <h2>2. Customer Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          It is the customer's responsibility to have read and accepted <strong>alt.bet</strong> Betting Rules
          prior
          to partaking in any market activity. The customer should contact <a href="#">support@altbet.net</a>  if he or she has any
          questions or concerns.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="disputes">
        <h2> 3. Customer Disputes</h2>
        <p>

          Rules were not properly enforced. Any disputes will be dealt with in a prompt and professional manner.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="settlement">
        <h2> 4. Settlement</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> will make every effort for bets to be settled as quickly as possible after the
          outcome has been determined. Where possible, we will rely on the official result publicized by the
          event's
          governing body. Otherwise, we will use publicly verifiable sources of information such as the ESPN or
          Yahoo
          Sports.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> reserves the right to delay settlement should the outcome be unclear or
          controversial.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> reserves the right to void or resettle markets should new information become
          available, such as cheating or rules violations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="voiding">
        <h2> 5. Voiding orders</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> reserves the right to void any markets where the outcome cannot be reasonably
          determined.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> reserves the right to void any trade for any reason before or after the event
          has
          occurred. This may be due to fraud, technical error or settlement error.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> reserves the right to recover funds that were disbursed in error.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> reserves the right to void orders deemed to be clearly erroneous, as outlined in
          the policy here.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="circumstances">
        <h2> 6. Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
        <p>
          Abandonments - If the event does not conclude within 36 hours of the scheduled time, all orders are
          void.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancellations - If the event is cancelled, all orders are void.
        </p>
        <p>
          Postponements - If an event is postponed more than 36 hours from the scheduled time, all orders are
          void.
        </p>
        <p>
          Change of Opponents - If there is a change in opponents for an event, all orders are void.
        </p>
        <p>
          Change of Venue - If there is a change in venue, all orders are void.
        </p>
        <p>
          Periods of Time - If the length of the event is modified, all orders are void.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dead Heat - In the event that there are more winners than expected, the winnings will be split
          proportionately.

        </p>
        <p>
          Change of Surface – If there is a change in surface all trade orders will stand.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="betting">
        <h2> 7. In-Play Betting</h2>
        <p>
          General <br>
          We will attempt to suspend markets and cancel trade orders at the end of an event. However, we cannot
          always
          guarantee that a market will be suspended and trade orders cancelled in time. Therefore it is important
          that
          users manage their in-play orders at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that a market is not suspended and trade orders cancelled at either the time of the start or
          the time of the finish of an event, we reserve the right to cancel any unmatched bets and/or void any
          matched trades made after this time. Determining the time of the start of the event will be in <strong>alt.bet</strong>
          ’s sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trading after the outcome of an event is known is not permitted. We reserve the right to void bets where
          a
          user has obtained an unfair advantage by placing trade orders after an event has occurred in a match or
          game
          (for example, by placing bets immediately after a goal is scored in order to take advantage of the price
          as
          it was before the goal.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Markets subject to an in-play betting delay
          Markets subject to an in-play betting delay are not managed. This means that markets will not be halted
          when
          there is a material event (for example a goal, penalty or red card). It is therefore important that
          users
          manage their in-play trade orders at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trades submitted on an in-play market will be subject to an in-play betting delay before being placed
          into
          the market. The trade order will also be unavailable to adjust or cancel until the expiration of this
          delay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customers may be trading against API users, who are subject to different arrangements for in-play
          markets.
          The <strong>alt.bet</strong> API is made available to liquidity providers.
        </p>

      <div id="specific">
        <h2> 8. Football Specific Rules</h2>
        <p>
          All football markets apply to the standard length of 90 minutes including stoppage time. These markets
          do
          not take overtime or penalties into account.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a football match is not properly completed, cancelled or otherwise abandoned, markets will be voided,
          except for bets on any markets that have been unconditionally determined. (i.e. half time markets if the
          match is abandoned in the second half).
        </p>
        <p>
          Types of Football Markets Offered: <br>
          Winner - This market will be settled on which team has won. <br>
          Handicaps - These markets will settle based on the point spread at the end of the game
        </p>
        <p>
          Outright markets: <br>
          A season or competition is declared as started once the first game of the scheduled season or
          competition
          has begun.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a team is thrown out, disqualified or otherwise removed from a league, one of two actions will
          apply:
        </p>
        <p>If this happens prior to the relevant season starting, all bets on affected markets will be void;</p>
        <p>
          If this happens after the relevant season has started, affected markets will stand and the team will be
          deemed to be relegated and all bets on that team will be settled accordingly (assuming that before the
          end
          of the season said team is not reinstated).
        </p>
        <p>
          'Outright Winner' markets will be settled on the final position/points total of teams at the completion
          of
          all scheduled matches. In the event of two or more teams tying the result will be determined by the
          official
          result of the governing body. Dead heat rules apply.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="tennis">
        <h2> 9. Tennis Specific Rules </h2>
        <p>
          If the first set of a match is not completed, all bets related to the match will be voided.
        </p>
        <p>
          When there is uncertainty about the outcome of an incomplete or cancelled match, <strong>alt.bet</strong>
          will settle match trades according to which player or pairing goes through to the next round, or who
          wins
          the tournament overall if the match is a final.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any cancellation, postponement or change to the length of a tournament will void all trades relating to
          occurrences of certain events within a tournament unless the outcome of those markets has already been
          determined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any change to the scheduled number of games or sets required to win a match, or a retirement or
          disqualification during a game or set, will void trades on affected game and set markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> s will not void trades due to changes in venue or changes in the playing
          surface.
          For tournament winner markets, all trades stand run or not.
        </p>
