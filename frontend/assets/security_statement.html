            <h2>Security Statement</h2>


            <p><strong>Alt.bet</strong> is constantly concerned about our member's critical information and privacy.
                With this in mind, we
                have the following security services installed on our Internet server:</p>

            <p> Each server is behind a Firewall. This UNIX based hardware product blocks critical ports and IP
                addresses on
                servers from external attack and access.</p>
            <p>Each server runs proprietary software that constantly monitors the servers for unauthorized use and
                attempts
                to "hack" into information. Administrators are contacted when forced attacks are committed, and
                countermeasures can be applied to stop these instances.</p>
            <p> All administrative activity requires user login and authentication. All administrative updates are
                logged
                into files that can be reviewed later.</p>
            <p>All servers come with a Global Verisign Certificate (RSA) for digitally encrypted communications between
                the
                Web server and you our member. Information passed in applications cannot be decrypted by third parties
                attempting to "pick" information being passed across the Internet backbone.</p>
            <p>All servers run the latest version of Apache Web Server, considered the strongest and most secure Web
                server
                software on the market.</p>
