      <h1>Payment Methods</h1>

      <p>Alt.Bet offers a variety of payment methods with which you can deposit
        to and withdraw from the site.</p>
      <p>Some payment methods are more expensive than others to offer. We
        charge no fees for Visa debit cards, Euro bank transfers within Europe,
        and UK Maestro cards, but we may charge fees to cover the costs of
        offering other methods.</p>
      <p><strong>For instant and free deposits and unlimited withdrawals we
        strongly recommend using a Visa debit card if possible.</strong></p>
      <p>We will endeavor to process your withdrawal as quickly as possible
        during business hours Monday to Friday, after which there may be a
        delay while it is processed by the banks or payment providers. The
        times in the table below are an estimate of how long funds will take to
        be returned to you by each method.</p>
