        <p>
          You may only place a bet, if you have sufficient funds in your <strong>alt.bet</strong> account. Once
          settled, the bet will
          be governed by the version of Terms and Conditions and Betting Rules valid at the time the bet is
          accepted.
        </p>

        <p>
          A bet is deemed to have been placed as soon as confirmation of the acceptance of the betting offer is
          received on the device or computer of the account holder from <strong>alt.bet</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          You declare that at the time you place a bet, you have no knowledge as to the outcome of the respective
          events. Bets on games in which you have gained access to insider information are not allowed. Where
          there is
          a suspicion of a violation of this rule, <strong>alt.bet</strong> retains the right to void the bet and
          refuse to pay out
          winnings. It also retains the right to take any further action to protect its legitimate interests and
          to
          comply with other laws and regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bets placed after the outcome of an event has been determined may be voided at <strong>alt.bet</strong>’s
          discretion.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> retains the right to suspend any market and to cancel existing offers, if
          necessary.
        </p>

        <p>The list of all the bets, their status and details are available to you on the website after login.</p>

        <p> Should betting on an event be stopped, you will be refunded the whole amount of your open offer(s).</p>

        <p>
          Should <strong>alt.bet</strong> decide to close your account, bets which have already been placed and
          accepted will not be
          voided and you will be paid any winnings.
        </p>

        <p>All bets are matched based on percentage pricing;</p>

        <p>
          You may cancel unmatched offers. You are reminded that not all of your original offer may remain
          available
          for cancellation; some or all may have already been matched with another customer. Please also note that
          once an order has been placed on the exchange, there is no guarantee that you will be able to amend,
          withdraw or cancel it.
        </p>

        <p>
          A mistake regarding the details of a trade order placement will not influence the validity of the
          bet.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> reserves the right to void all bets on a market where incorrect information is
          displayed or where
          there is an error in the market or event.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you place a bet, you acknowledge that you have read and understood in full all of the terms and
          conditions and game rules regarding the bets offered by <strong>alt.bet</strong> as stated on the
          website.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you place a bet, you recognize that unless other customers back this bet, the bet will not be
          matched
          and therefore you cannot win even if the outcome of the event is as predicted.
        </p>

        <p>
          When placing a bet, you are aware that you may be betting against software applications such as bots or
          trading software.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to provide a better betting service, <strong>alt.bet</strong> partners with liquidity providers
          in
          order to ensure
          price coverage on the maximum number of markets.
        </p>

        <p>
          When placing a bet, you are aware that slower devices or internet speeds may hamper user experience and
          provide disadvantages when navigating the site and placing bets on the exchange.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Alt.bet</strong> manages your account, calculates the available funds, the pending funds, the
          betting funds as well
          as the amount of the winnings. Unless proved otherwise, these amounts are considered as final and are
          deemed
          to be accurate.
        </p>

        <p>You must check that the liability and potential payout are correct before placing bets.</p>

        <p>
          You are responsible for ensuring that your satisfy yourself that any bet placed is on the intended
          selection. For example, in the case of two football teams playing each other in different competitions
          in
          quick succession you must ensure that you know you are placing the bet on the chosen event.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a better price is available in the market you will be matched at that price (or prices) dependent on
          the
          liquidity available. This process is called "best price execution" and will be applied automatically
          when
          appropriate for your bet. This means that if you place a sell bet with price of $0.50, but another
          customer
          is already offering bet to buy of $0.55, your bet will be matched at the more favorable price of $0.55
          When
          best price execution occurs, it is bet quantity which stays constant after you benefit from a better
          price.
          Bet quantity is defined as number of contracts at predetermined price. So the new stake (after BPE) =
          the
          bet quantity/new better prices.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are fully responsible for the bets placed on <strong>alt.bet</strong>. <strong>alt.bet</strong> will
          never question you about the
          relevance of the bets you wish to place and will not be held responsible for mistakes that could have
          been
          made during the placing of such bets, including the stake amounts, price or side of the bet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Winnings will be paid into your account after the final result is confirmed. However,
          <strong>alt.bet</strong> reserves the
          right to set aside any winnings should there be investigations into the result of an event caused by a
          suspicion of criminal activities that may have affected the result of the event. If the irregularity is
