      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <h2>Trading Basics: </h2>
      <p><strong>Alt.bet</strong> allows you to make predictions on future events either by buying or selling
        contracts
        in the probable outcome. Each outcome has a probability between 1 and 99 percent. We convert those
        probabilities
        into monetary values in real accounts or virtual currency in free accounts.</p>
      <p>For example, Bettor A thinks in sporting event has at least a 75 percent chance of Team X to win so he or
        she
        offers 75 cents for a unit. <strong>alt.bet</strong> matches Bettor A offer with that of Trader B, who
        is willing
        to pay 25 cents for Team Y unit. Each trader now owns number of units in the market for this event on
        opposite sides.</p>
      <p>The prices of units will change over time as probabilities change and both bettors could decide to buy or
        sell
        their units at any time. A key to success <strong>alt.bet</strong>
        is knowing when to buy and sell in order to take a profit or prevent a loss.</p>
      <p>If Team X wins, its units are redeemed at $1. Team Y’s units become worthless. If Team X does not win
        before the
        market closes, bettors holding units in Team Y will be paid $1, while Team X’s units will be
        worthless.</p>

      <h2>Choosing Markets</h2>
      <p>Every market has a specification about a potential future event. Some markets feature events that have
        simple
        outcomes based on these specifications, while others offer multiple possible outcomes. Each of these
        options is
        known as a ‘contracts’.</p>
      <p>Besides main board, every market has its own page showing the latest prices and trading metrics
        available. Pay
        particularly close attention to the Rules and Specifications for each market. These describe the
        criteria that
        will be used to decide whether your prediction comes true or not.</p>

      <h2>Placing An Order (Bet)</h2>
      <p>Placing an order or bet at <strong>Alt.bet</strong> no different than at a regular sportsbook. Simply

        the box showing the best price available, enter your desired number of units, and press BUY/SELL. The
        unit amount
        in the box shows the current depth of liquidity available to bet at that price.</p>

      <h2>Buy (Back) and Sell (Lay) </h2>
      <p>To <strong>‘Buy’</strong> a selection in a market is to place a bet for something to happen. This is like
        a bet that you would place with a regular sportsbook and is explained above.</p>
      <p>To <strong>‘Sell’</strong> a selection in a market is to place a bet for something NOT to happen, or in
        other words, bet against something happening.</p>
      <!--<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/archive/7/74/20150204121152!%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BA_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8.gif"-->
      <h2>Example:</h2>
      <p>If you want to <strong>Sell</strong> Team Y, or back them NOT to win, the best price available is $.36.
        Click on the red box and your order will appear in the order pad, as below. Enter your size and press
        “Submit”.</p>

      <h2>Market Exposure</h2>
      <p>One of the basic principles of <strong>Alt.bet</strong> is that a customer is only allowed to risk funds
        that are available in their account.</p>
      <p>Market exposure is the term that represents the amount of money that has been reserved to cover the
        unmatched and matched orders placed on your account.</p>
      <p>Each time you place an order (a bet), or make a change to an unmatched order, your market exposure will
        be adjusted accordingly.</p>
      <p><strong>Alt.bet</strong> will also reserve funds to cover the trading fees you will have to pay once your
        order has been
        settled.</p>
      <h2>Trading Fees</h2>
      <p><strong>Alt.bet</strong> charges or rebates tiered trading fees when you place an order. For more
        information, see Trading
        Fees.</p>

      <p>In order to provide deep liquidity and ensure transparent and continuously flowing market, <strong>Alt.bet</strong>
        will facilitate its business not only to retail bettors but also to Liquidity Providers (LPs) and
        licensed gaming operators – Market Makers ( MMs).</p>
